# runTracker
Need to: get nodemon working?
design style,
decide how data will be displayed, 
make api,
make database/web server, 
display data from api on page.

What data do I want to track?
Have boxes for: time, distance, date. Maybe have a graph with data to track improvement. 


Design:
Maybe have a free image of someone running, or an image of me running?
Make sure "about" goes somewhere.

Features:
read and parse an external file into your app and display some data
Probably create a form and save the values to an external file--must show or document where info is being stored. 
Probably create a function with two parameters that determines a value and returns it,
Might visualize data in a graph or whatever, 
Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from app using express. 
Maybe add a nodemailer that emails me if i miss too many runs in a row
